# Google-Cloud-based-ALPR
A simple to use python script for Automatic License Plate Recognition using Google Cloud Vision API.
Add your API keys, call the program with the path to your image, and you are good to go. 
Note: I have fine-tuned it to work for Indian License Plates. I have used regular expressions to make filters for the same. More such regex for other countries can be added, feel free to add more such functions.

Please find more details to use in the Wiki.
